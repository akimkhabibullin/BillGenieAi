# 🧞‍♂️ BillGenieAI

**BillGenieAI** is an AI-powered tool designed to help patients understand, verify, and dispute hospital billing charges with transparency and confidence.  
Our goal is simple: make medical billing clear, fair, and accessible for everyone.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Every hospital visit results in an **itemized bill** filled with **CPT** and **ICD** codes — cryptic shorthand used by hospitals to describe treatments, consultations, and procedures.  
Often, patients are charged for services they never received or misunderstand due to unclear medical terminology.

**BillGenieAI** automatically analyzes your hospital bill and:
- 🧩 Decodes every medical and billing code into plain English  
- ⚠️ Flags potential overcharges or mismatched items  
- 📄 Generates an easy-to-read report for billing review or insurance appeal
